# Housekeeping

Housekeeping and maintenance have the same layout as Room Service, there is one difference which is **“Preferred Time”**, if enabled, your guest will be able to schedule the specific time of their request.

**Quantity Limit:** Housekeeping items can be limited in quantity by enabling the button and adding a number in Max# Qty

Note: Each item in the same category can have a different Quantity limit.

For example, the hotel can provide 2 toothpaste at maximum, then you can put 2 for Max#

For Maintenance, the categories are pre-set but you can customize choices according to your hotel.
